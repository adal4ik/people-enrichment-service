```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/people-enrichment-service.git
cd people-enrichment-service
```

### 2. Fill in the `.env` file

Example:
```
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=people
```

### 3. Start the service and database with Docker

```sh
make up
```

The service will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

### 4. Stop the service

```sh
make down
```

### 5. Local run (without Docker)

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and matches your `.env` settings
- Apply migrations (e.g., via `psql` or a migration tool)
- Run the application:

```sh
make run
```

### 6. Makefile commands help

To see all available Makefile commands:

```sh
make help
```

You will see a list of commands for managing the service, containers, and building the project.

## API Documentation

You can visualize it using [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/).

## How to view Swagger

1. Start the service:
   ```sh
